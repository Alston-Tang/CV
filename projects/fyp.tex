\protitle{Program for Dummy Fill Insertion}{Sep, 2014 -- May, 2015}{The Chinese University of Hong Kong}
\begin{cventry}
  \item Efficiently solved a complex optimization problem in dummy fill insertion with better performance and result than all any other methods to our best knowledge.
  \item Program included: Fast polygon decomposition (\textit{O(N)}); Fast rectangle overlap detection (\textit{$O(N^{\frac{3}{2}}))$}); Efficient insertion decision based on fast median\textit{O(N)}; Multi-core optimization; GDS binary reader and writer
